Planning unit,PU,The spatial- or spatial-temporal unit over which a decision is made and that can be managed independently.Typical examples include a grid cell or vector shape (such as farmland or country borders).,Authors
Target,T,An explicit parameter quantifying the desired representation of a given feature in the prioritization. ,"Adapted from Margules, C. R., & Sarkar, S. (2007). Systematic conservation planning. Cambridge University Press. "
Representation,,"Can be measured as the fraction of features that meet their set of targets. Or alternatively, if targets have not been formulated, as the fraction of the total amount of a feature covered by a solution.","Adapted from Margules, C. R., & Sarkar, S. (2007). Systematic conservation planning. Cambridge University Press. "
Representativeness ,,"A representative system of conservation areas is one that includes a representative sample of all biodiversity present in a region taking into account composition (e.g. species and genetic diversity), structure (e.g. habitat types) and function (e.g. recruitment and dispersal processes).",
Features,F,"In SCP features are biotic (e.g. species) and/or non-biotic (e.g., ecosystem services) elements that are desireable to represent in the prioritization. The set of features to be included in the planning process depends on the planning objectives, available data and stakeholder preferences.",Authors
Systematic conservation planning,SCP,"Systematic conservation planning consists of the use of protocols to identify areas or actions that should have priority for the allocation of [scarce] management resources and separate them from processes which threaten their persistence. Systematic conservation planning is usually implemented with software tools using digital georeferenced data sets and area-selection algorithms. It is a structured step-wise approach to mapping conservation area networks, with feedback, revision and reiteration, where needed, at any stage.","Adapted from Margules, C. R., & Sarkar, S. (2007). Systematic conservation planning. Cambridge University Press. "
Spatial prioritization,,Synonym for the application of an area- or action based algorithm for identifying a set of places (or areas) nominated for the implementation of conservation management (or combination of management actions) over a period of time. Distinct from SCP as it captures only the statistical part of any planning exercise.,Authors
Solution,s,A single output from a spatial prioritization process.,Authors
Cost,c,"Social, economic, and political constraints associated with conservation actions such as costs related to acquisition (e.g., cost of buying land), management (e.g., enforcement and implementing costs of protected areas), transactions (e.g., costs associated with negotiating protection), and opportunity cost (i.e., estimates of foregone revenues or economic livelihoods from protecting an area).",Authors
Complementarity,,Measure of the contribution of an area in a planning region towards the full complement of [biodiversity] features. A set of complementary planning units in a solution increase the likelihood for a conservation network [or action[ to be comprehensive.,"Adapted from Margules, C. R., & Sarkar, S. (2007).

Connectivity,,"A connected system of conservation areas ensures the flow of materials, including energy, organisms, and/or genes, among habitat patches, ecosystems or regions of interest.

There are numerous ways to account for connectivity in spatial prioritization.","Beger, M et al. (2022) Demystifying ecological connectivity for actionable spatial conservation planning, Trends Ecol.

Cost-efficiency,,A cost-efficient network of priority areas that meets the conservation objectives at the least costs. Cost-efficiency is important because it facilitates future expansion of a network of priority areas through the prudent use of conservation resources and is more likely to be defensible in light of competing interests,"Wilson, K.A., Cabeza, M. and Klein, C.J., 2009. Fundamental concepts of spatial conservation prioritization. Spatial conservation prioritization: Quantitative methods and computational tools, pp.16-27."
