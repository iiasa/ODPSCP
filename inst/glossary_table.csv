Term,Abbreviation,Definition,Reference
Planning unit,PU,The spatial- or spatial-temporal geographical unit over which a decision is made. Typical examples include a grid cell or vector shape (such as farmland or country borders).,Authors
Target,T,An explicit parameter quantifying the desired representation of a given feature in the prioritization. ,"Adapted from Margules, C. R., & Sarkar, S. (2007). Systematic conservation planning. Cambridge University Press. "
Representation,,Can be measured as the fraction of features that meet their set of targets. Or alternatively if targets have not been formulated as the fraction of the total amount of a feature covered by a solution.,"Adapted from Margules, C. R., & Sarkar, S. (2007). Systematic conservation planning. Cambridge University Press. "
Features,F,A set of quantitative datasets included in the planning process and over which priorities should be identified. Examples include for example spatial[-temporal] estimates of species distribution or abundance.,Authors
Systematic conservation planning,SCP,"Systematic conservation planning consists of the use of protocols to identify areas or actions that should have priority for the allocation of [scarce] management resources and separate them from processes which threaten their persistence. Systematic conservation planning is usually implemented with software tools using digital georeferenced data sets and area-selection algorithms. It is a structured step-wise approach to mapping conservation area networks, with feedback, revision and reiteration, where needed, at any stage.","Adapted from Margules, C. R., & Sarkar, S. (2007). Systematic conservation planning. Cambridge University Press. "
Spatial prioritization,,Synonym for the application of an area- or action based algorithm for identifying priority areas. Distinct SCP as it captures only the statistical part of any planning exercise.,Authors
Solution,s,A single output from a spatial prioritization process.,Authors
Cost,c,A [spatial-explicit] estimate of the cost of selecting a given area or action as a priority.,Authors
Complementarity,,Measure of the contribution of an area in a planning region towards the full complement of [biodiversity] features. A set of complementary planning units in a solution increase the likelihood for a conservation network [or action[ to be comprehensive.,"Adapted from Margules, C. R., & Sarkar, S. (2007). Systematic conservation planning. Cambridge University Press.  And Wilson, K.A., Cabeza, M. and Klein, C.J., 2009. Fundamental concepts of spatial conservation prioritization. Spatial conservation prioritization: Quantitative methods and computational tools, pp.16-27."
Comprehensiveness,,Defined as a set of priority areas that include at a minimum a portion of every feature used in the planning.,"Wilson, K.A., Cabeza, M. and Klein, C.J., 2009. Fundamental concepts of spatial conservation prioritization. Spatial conservation prioritization: Quantitative methods and computational tools, pp.16-27."
Cost-efficiency,,"A cost-efficient network of priority areas is one that is comprehensive, representative, and/or adequate for the least possible cost.  Cost-efficiency is important because it facilitates future expansion of a network of priority areas through the prudent use of conservation resources and is more likely to be defensible in light of competing interests","Wilson, K.A., Cabeza, M. and Klein, C.J., 2009. Fundamental concepts of spatial conservation prioritization. Spatial conservation prioritization: Quantitative methods and computational tools, pp.16-27."
Irreplaceability,,Measures the value of the inclusion of a planning unit in a solution relative to specified targets and other constraints.,"Wilson, K.A., Cabeza, M. and Klein, C.J., 2009. Fundamental concepts of spatial conservation prioritization. Spatial conservation prioritization: Quantitative methods and computational tools, pp.16-27."
Constraint,,A constraint placed on whether or to what extent a given area can be selected as priority.,Authors
Pressure,,A human activity that immediately degrades one or more biodiversity focal values.,"Salafsky et al. (2024) A standard lexicon of terms for area-based conservation version 1.0, Conservation Biology, https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.14269"
Theory of Change,,The explicit or implicit set of assumptions that outlines how a given action will lead to desired intermediate and ultimate outcomes.,"Salafsky et al. (2024) A standard lexicon of terms for area-based conservation version 1.0, Conservation Biology, https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.14269"
Indicator,,"A measure of a given variable, often used to assess progress toward the target in a goal or objective or the achievement of a criterion in an effectiveness framework.  Can be the result of a modelling process. In the context of SCP often used for evaluating solutions in terms of their efficiency.","Adapted from Salafsky et al. (2024) A standard lexicon of terms for area-based conservation version 1.0, Conservation Biology, https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.14269"
Gap analysis,,The process of evaluating an existing protected area network or management scheme in terms of its value in conserving biodiversity or other features.,Authors
Zones,z,"A zone specifies the extent over which a decision is to be applied. Most SCP software make use of only one zone, however some allow multiple zones and are able to account accounting for the relationships between them.","Authors,  https://marxansolutions.org"
Decision variable,x,A variable in a problem formulation used for some SCP applications and typically determining the output allocation (e.g. binary allocation of potential protected area).,Authors
Objective function,,In the context of decision theory and mathematical optimization a specific function (usually minimize or maximize) that determines the outcome of the decision variable subject to all constraints.,Authors
Benefit function,,"Usually used for (meta-)heuristic algorithms that estimate the benefit, through a specific step, linear or non-linear function, of carrying out a given action with an increasing amount of the decision variable selected.","Arponen, A., Heikkinen, R. K., Thomas, C. D., & Moilanen, A. (2005). The value of biodiversity in reserve selection: representation, species weighting, and benefit functions. Conservation Biology, 19(6), 2009-2014."
